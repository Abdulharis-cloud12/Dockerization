# 🐳 Dockerized Python URL Parser

A DevOps project that demonstrates how to containerize a simple Python script using Docker. The script parses a URL and displays its components like Scheme, domain, path, port number, parameters, etc.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a great starting point for understanding how to:
- Create a `Dockerfile`
- Build a Python image
- Run a containerized Python script
- Work with basic URL parsing logic using Python’s standard library

---

## 🧠 What the Script Does:-

The 'url.py' script contains a hardcoded URL and extracts:

- ✅ Scheme
- ✅ Netlocations / Domain
- ✅ Path
- ✅ Parameters
- ✅ Port number
- ✅ Total URL

---

It's ideal for Docker experimentation without GUI complexities.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
   🐍 Python 3.12 (slim image)
   🐳 Docker

🎯 Use Cases:-

 1. Learn Docker basics with Python
 2. Run Python scripts in isolated environments
 3. Build foundational DevOps skills
 4. Practice container builds for microservices
